# Docker vs VM

- operation guy give you a document with instruction how to set up server/machine
  - install nginx, apache, php, python, dotnet --- that annoying because you could have configuration issues
- people came up with idea of virtual machines
- Hardware, host OS, Hypervisor (Hyper-V, VMWare, VirtualBox), multiple virtual machines
  - VM could be not small
- Why if you could get rid of hypervisor and VM and bringing stuff closer to host os
- you could isolate via docker
  - docker containers as slim VM

* Process isolation
* VMs introduces overhead in case of lightweight applications
  * You generally don't have ssh access to container, but this is intentional because container is a running version of image (snapshot), so when you need to change configuration, you should change snapshot.
* Each container runs in its own environnement based on linux namespaces. No emulation or virtualization involved.
* Containers package all dependencies
* Containers are disposable
* Docker containers are designed to be stateless

# Structure 

1. Idea explain why VM managing is hard (configuration of host environment + configuration of dependencies)
